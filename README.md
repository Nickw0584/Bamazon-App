This project allows developers to build a small data set in sql and 
pull the information as if they were working wih a large store.

The project starts us getting used to big data and manipulating it.

I would start this project by getting the database done and then hooking up the server that is a good place to start.

If you decide to tackle this project i would suggest going over inquirer.

This project will be maintained by me the first developer and any one that choose to fix and make it there own.
